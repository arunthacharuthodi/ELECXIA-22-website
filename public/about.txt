MAHacks (https://mahacks.com) is the Boston area’s only 24-hour high-school hackathon. MAHacks VI is happening from March 19th to 20th in Boston for over 200 students.  It's completely free to attend. Students—from beginners to seasoned programmers—get all the resources to code, learn, and make together over a weekend. Students have the opportunity to work on a team of up to 4 people, and compete to win prizes. We hope to see you there. Apply at https://mahacks.com/registration.
