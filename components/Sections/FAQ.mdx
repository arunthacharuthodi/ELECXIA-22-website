### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a fun event where students work together to brainstorm, code, design, and present projects, such as apps, websites, and hardware. At MAHacks, you can expand your skills, make new friends, and create something valuable! **No, we aren't destructively "hacking" servers or databases** - in this context, the word "hacking" means building things using code. MAHacks is safe, supervised, and educational.
